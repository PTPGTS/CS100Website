        <h1>Pratham Yadav</h1>
        <h2>Computer Science Major</h2>

        <p>
          Hi, my name is Pratham. I am a freshman at George Mason University
          pursuing a degree in computer science, and I spend a lot of time
          balancing classes, homework, and learning new concepts in coding and
          technology. When I am not studying, I like to relax and recharge by
          doing the things I enjoy most. I love playing basketball with my
          friends, going to the gym to stay active, and playing video games to
          unwind. Music is also a big part of my life, and I really enjoy
          playing my guitar and pushing myself to learn new songs and improve a
          little bit every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another important part of who I am is my love for traveling; I have
          visited France, Italy, and India, and each place has given me new
          experiences and helped me see different cultures and ways of life.
          My dog Pluto, a small shih tzu who always makes me smile, is like my
          little best friend, and spending time with him is one of the best
          parts of my day. Overall, I try to keep growing as a person by
          learning new things, staying active, and appreciating the people and
          experiences around me.

    <section id="lessons">
      <h2>Lessons Learned in CS 100</h2>

      <p>
        In CS 100 I was introduced to the basics of computer science and how
        computers actually solve problems, which helped me understand what is
        happening behind the scenes when we run programs or use different types
        of software. I learned how to think more logically by breaking problems
        into smaller, clear steps using algorithms and pseudocode, and this
        made it easier to approach assignments in a more organized way. The
        class also gave me practice with simple programming concepts and showed
        me how code, data, and hardware all connect to each other. Another
        important lesson from CS 100 was how to use new tools and programs on
        my own, including reading instructions carefully, fixing errors, and
        not getting discouraged when something did not work the first time.
        These experiences taught me to be more patient and independent as a
        learner, which I know will help me in future computer science courses
        and in my career. Overall, CS 100 gave me a solid starting point and
        helped confirm that I really want to keep going in computer science.
